# Pitching Mechanics â€” Rotational Kinematic Sequence âš¾

## Overview
This project provides tools to **analyze and visualize the rotational kinematic sequence** of baseball pitchers using sample joint angle CSV data from Driveline's Open Source Data. It plots **pelvis, torso, and throwing shoulder rotation** over time for each pitching session, and highlights the timing of **Maximum External Rotation (MER)** if available.

## Features
- ðŸ“Š **Session Splitting**  
  - Supports datasets with `session_id` or automatic splitting when time resets to 0.  
- ðŸ§® **MER Detection**  
  - Uses the `MER_time` column (in **seconds**) to mark the critical MER event.  
- ðŸŽ¨ **Visualization**  
  - Creates plots of pelvis, torso, and throwing shoulder rotation vs. time.  
  - Annotates MER with a dashed vertical line when available.  
- ðŸ’¾ **Batch Processing**  
  - Run on all sessions in a file or select a specific session.  
- ðŸ”Ž **Error Checking**  
  - Detects missing or mislabeled columns and reports them clearly.
