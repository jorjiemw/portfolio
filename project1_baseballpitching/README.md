# âš¾ Baseball Pitching Biomechanics Visualizer

### ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project uses **sample of motion capture landmark data** from Driveline's Open Source Biomechanics data to analyze and visualize pitching mechanics.  
It generates **3D skeleton animations** frame by frame, and splits recordings into **sessions** whenever the `time` column resets.

### ðŸ”‘ Features
- **3D Skeleton Animation**: Connects joints frame by frame to visualize pitching mechanics.  
- **Session Splitting**: Automatically detects when the `time` column resets to zero and creates a new session.  
- **Export**: Saves session as GIF or MP4 for easy sharing.  
- **Analysis Ready**: Prepares data for angle calculations (e.g., elbow flexion, shoulder rotation).
